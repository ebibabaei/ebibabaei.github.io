    "title": "Awareness about Limitations",
    "content": "Awareness about limitations . Like any other physiological signal, EDA has limitations that make it unsuitable for certain HCI paradigms. EDA is a slowly changing signal—SCRs to a stimulus or arousal-induced tonic changes have a delay of 1 to 3 seconds [12]. Adding the computational delay for detecting an SCR or a SCL shift might introduce even further lag. Therefore, EDA may not be suitable for HCI applications that require real-time responses such as modalities for game interactions or biofeedback for drivers. Further, a core topic of HCI research is the recognition of physical and mental activity in everyday settings. Studies that investigate these are traditionally conducted in laboratory settings followed by in-the-wild setups utilizing medical-grade devices and mostly apply no restriction on participants’ activities and movements and in most cases tasks include intense movements and activities. On the other hand, the correct sensor placement and signal processing approaches are crucial for obtaining meaningful EDA signals. Consequently, a potentially incorrect placement of the sensors, or displacement during a study (which is likely in the presence of intense movements), and the resulting very low signal-noise-ratio (SNR) through motion artifacts increase the risk of false signal readings [20, 21]. In addition to motion artifacts, during intense physical activities, the human body increases sweating to lower the body temperature, which also affects the EDA signal. Furthermore, due to the realistic tasks in most of in-the-wild setups, HCI researchers are forced to use less obtrusive and less invasive mobile EDA devices to conduct their studies which record lower quality EDA signals. Therefore, before designing such studies, considering the activities in our study, we must make sure if EDA is a fit for measuring psychological constructs in our study. EDA caused by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system which is responsible for fight or flight actions and mostly causes negative feeling such as stress and arousal. Therefore, the ability of EDA in measuring physiological signals is limited to negative physiological constructs. For instance, EDA has not shown any evidence of insight about the positive experience of valence [10]. ",

    "content": "Discrete vs Continous Stimuli . The first crucial step when designing an EDA study is to decide on the type of stimulus to be used. Depends on the goal of their study and the type of their stimulus researchers have to pick from three paradigms for using EDA—presenting discrete stimuli, presenting continuous stimuli, and investigating the correlation of individual traits and EDA [12]. We note that all works in our sample in the paper, A Critique of Electrodermal Activity Practices at CHI [--] involved only the first two paradigms. - First Paradigm: When designing a study where a series of discrete stimuli, each lasting a few seconds, is presented to participants, interleaved with rest periods (Inter-Stimulus Interval (ISI)), researchers shall use phasic parameters of the EDA signal. The phasic parameters enable measuring novelty, significance, and intensity of the stimuli used. In our sample of papers, orienting response (see Section 4.7 of paper) is the only discrete stimulus paradigm employed in CHI. - Second Paradigm: Contrary to the first paradigm, studies investigating the effect of continuous stimuli, such as long lasting situations or tasks, on EDA, shall analyse the tonic parameters of the EDA signal. Tonic parameters, such as SCL and NS.SCR frequency, are defined by the before-mentioned slow response to changes in conditions such as cognitive workload or stress. SCL and NS.SCR frequencies are the most common measures in this paradigm, which is the most widely used paradigm in current EDA studies published at CHI. ",

The choice of which parameters of the EDA signal to analyse should be informed by previous works on the correlation between them and different psychological constructs. For example, the SCL and the NS.SCR frequency correlate with arousal [8] and the SCR amplitude correlates with the intensity of a stimulus [17]. Further, if deciding to use phasic parameters of EDA, researchers must decide on the interval between the presentation of two stimuli—Inter Stimulus Interval (ISI). Generally, ISI reported in previous works vary between 20-60s [12], but choosing shorter ISI (e.g., 2-3 sec) is possible if using approaches based on mathematical models [8] such as mathematical deconvolution models [1, 6] for analysis.

Therefore, it is important to minimize them as much as possible starting with the study designs. This includes ensuring that the EDA sensors are properly attached to the participant’s body. Furthermore, unnecessary speaking and movement should be avoided. If that is not possible, additional modalities can be recorded synchronously, such as movement through accelerometer and gyroscope, or audio level through microphones, in order to be able to detect their potential affect on the EDA signal. Especially physical activity, such as spontaneous arm movements, might require looking at the spectral band of the EDA signal, as brisk movements typically result in the representation of a typical 0.37 Hz components in the EDA signal. Further, if comparing EDA signals in different conditions of an experiment, it is important to balance the effects of these external factors across conditions. Temperature and humidity are ambient variables that may impact EDA recordings [7]. Though it may not be possible to control them in ambulatory recordings, they should be controlled in laboratory studies. ",

Further, caffeine and drug consumption by participants prior to the study must be checked and balanced between groups. In particular, Boucsein et al. [8] suggest to exclude participants who take anticholinergic medicines from the analysis, because they interfere with the main neurotransmitter of the parasympathetic nervous system, acetylcholine Posada-Quintero and Chon [19]. As Acetylcholine regulates the sweat glands that are mainly innervated by cholinergic fibre Shields et al. [23], allergy medication, cold medication, or antidepressants, potentially affect skin conductance. ",

Before beginning any data collection, researchers have to ensure the proper preparation of the part of the skin where the electrode will be attached to, e.g., by washing it with lukewarm water. If required, researchers should apply electrolyte on the electrodes and attach them to the skin of the participant. Then, they should wait 5-10 minutes to make participants ready for the recording for optimal electrical contact with the sweat glands Boucsein et al. [8]. Furthermore, the risk of electrolytes influencing the discharge and absorption potential of the ducts can be mitigated by waiting for 5-10 minutes after applying the electrolyte Boucsein et al. [8]. As the study progresses, researchers must check for a potential electrical drift from time to time, which long-term studies are especially prone to. Drifts usually appear as climbing tonic SCL signal components Braithwaite et al. [9]. The main problem with this is to differentiate if a drift is caused by tonic processes or by artefacts. If a drift is detected, e.g., by comparing to a separate baseline recording Posada-Quintero et al. [21] (see Braithwaite et al. [9] for a detailed guide on how to differentiate drift from tonic processes). We developed a summarizing flowchart of the steps researchers must take for running an EDA study according to Boucsein et al.

[11] recommends setting a signal-change threshold criterion and reject changes that violate this threshold. Kleckner et al.

    "title": "Peak Detection Approaches",
    "content": ". In this section, we describe the conventional peak detection approach for analysing and parameterising EDA signals. Depending on the parameters of interest, the following process can be followed for phasic and tonic parameters. | Phasic parameters: In the presence of a stimulus, one can measure EDA parameters by following these steps, derived from Dawson et al. [12]’s and Boucsein [7]’s recommendations. | Choose a time window for latency: The presentation of a stimulus may cause SCRs, but the skin may generate 1 to 3 NS.SCR per minute [12]. Therefore, it is necessary to specify a time window during which it is assumed that a SCR is related to the corresponding stimulus. Recommended time window is 1-3 sec or 1-4 sec [12]. | Decide on the minimum amplitude criterion: Deflections in EDA signals may happen because of SCRs, device errors, or the movements of electrodes. Therefore it is necessary to define a minimum amplitude criterion, above which an EDA rise is assumed to be a response. Generally, values between 0.01-0.05𝜇𝑆 s are used as a minimum amplitude [12]. | Detect rise time: After detecting an SCR, the next step is to measure the rise time, which is the time between the initial onset and the consecutive peak. It can be measured using the first derivative of the EDA signal. At the point that first derivative stably becomes zero and negative afterward, peak is reached. a After measuring the rise time, one can compute the SCR amplitude by subtracting the peak from the EDA value before the onset. | Recovery Time: After detecting the peak, it is necessary to measure the recovery time. As defined in Table 1 in the paper, the recovery time is the period where there is a decline in amplitude after reaching the peak amplitude. However, such amplitude recovery does not happen fully, mostly due to tonic shifts in the EDA signal [7] and increased moisture on the skin because of SCR Boucsein et al. [8]. The characteristic exponential EDA recovery can be calculated using a time constant. It is usually measured as rec.t/2, i.e., the time to recover half of the SCR amplitude and rec.tc which is the time to recover 63% of the SCR amplitude Boucsein et al. [8]. | . | Tonic Parameters: Measuring tonic parameters of EDA is much easier than phasic parameters. Below, we explain the measurement process of two tonic parameters SCL and NS.SCR frequency. | SCL: Changes in SCL are much slower than SCR. It usually takes between 10 to 30s for SCL to change [7]. Therefore, to measure SCL, some methods simply use the mean [22] or minimum [7] of EDA values within an appropriate time interval (e.g., 10 seconds [7]). However, Dawson et al. [12] suggests to correct the range of SCLin which 𝑆𝐶𝐿𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑆𝐶𝐿𝑚𝑖𝑛 are maximum and minimum SCL experienced by participant during the experiment to correct SCL values based on range of participants’ SCL. | NS.SCR Frequency: This parameter describes the number of non-specific SCRs per minute in the absence of any stimulus, and can be computed by applying Step 2 (decide on minimum amplitude criterion) of measuring phasic parameters and counting the number of significant SCRs in a minute. In cases in which a stimulus was presented during the recording and still measuring NS.SCR frequency in ISIs are of interest, Boucsein [7] recommends to withdraw responses elicited earlier than 5 seconds after stimulus(as they may be caused by stimulus) and only consider responses elicited later than 5 seconds after stimulus terminates as NS.SCRs. | . | .

    "title": "Model-based Approaches",
    "content": "Model based Approaches . The main issue with the conventional peak detection method for analysis described so far is how it handles superimposed SCRs [5]. In this case, an SCR onset starts before the termination of the previous SCR, e.g., when the ISI is very short (e.g., 2 seconds). Based on the time that the second SCR starts, there might not be enough time for the first SCR to recover or, in some cases, even to reach its peak. This makes the conventional analysis challenging, because we cannot detect peaks and measure recovery time of an incomplete SCR. To address this issue, researchers have proposed model-based approaches. These models automatically decompose the EDA signal and measure phasic and tonic parameters. These approaches assume that sympathetic processes that generate EDA can be described as time series of a mathematical model (e.g. time-invariant model [3]) and then use the recorded EDA data to estimate the time series process that generated the EDA values. With this we can understand central process caused an EDA data and then we can measure EDA parameters. One of the most well-known methods for decomposing EDA data to tonic and phasic drivers is the Continuous Deconvolution Analysis (CDA) [5, 6], which uses a mathematical model of sweat diffusion. CDA is implemented in the LedaLab toolbox. Greco et al. [14] proposed cvxEDA, which considers EDA as an autonomic nervous system activity and models it using convex optimisation. Implementations of this model are publicly available1. Bach et al. [3] proposed another approach that assumes a linear time invariant model generates SCRs. This model is implemented in PsPM toolbox. SparsEDA [16] is another publicly available2 model which is fast and efficient in lower sample rates and suitable for wearable devices. In addition to above-mentioned models, many other models proposed for psycho-physiological modeling each assuming a different type of function is driver of SCR. Reviewing all these methods is out of scope of this paper; however, to find the best model to use for your study you can refer to reviews [2, 4, 15, 19] on these methods. 1.cvxEDA 2.sparseEDA . ",
